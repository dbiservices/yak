# Artifacts

Copy any files from an artifact provider (AWS S3, Azure Storage Blob, OCI object storage, etc)
into an instance at the specified location.

The role copies artifacts from the artifact provider to the destination instance (no intermediaries).

The role will preserve the target server's artifact path (directory structure). For instance, if you want `rdbms/oracle/dmk/dmk_dbbackup-21-02.zip` in `/tmp`, it will be copied like this: `/tmp/rdbms/oracle/dmk/dmk_dbbackup-21-02.zip`. Same behavior for all providers on Linux and Windows.

## Prerequisites

- The artifact structures and files must exist in the artifact provider.
- You must have correct credentials and permissions to access artifacts.
- Per artifact provider requisites:
  - `aws_s3`: a bucket named 'yak' and the AWS secret keys in environment variables.
  - `azure_storage_blob`: Azure Secrets of the artifact provider in the environment variable and `AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP` as an environment variable.
  - `oci_object_storage`: a bucket named 'yak' and the OCI secret keys in environment variables, including `OCI_ANSIBLE_AUTH_TYPE` (ex: api_key).
  - `yak_local_storage`: A local directory in the container with the artifacts. This would most likely be a mount point from the host. The default is `/yak_local_storage,` but you can change the default by changing the inventory environment variable `artifacts.variables.path`.

### From configuration

The configuration dictionary variable can be stored in the global `variables.yml` file, in an infrastructure `variables.yml` file, or for each server in the server's `variables.yml` file.

- `artifacts`
  - `provider`: the supported provider of your artifacts:
    - `aws_s3`
    - `azure_storage_blob`
    - `oci_object_storage`
    - `yak_local_storage`
  - `variables`: dictionary of variables specific to an artifact provider.
    - `aws_s3`:
      - `bucket_name`
    - `azure_storage_blob`:
      - `storage_account_name`
      - `container`
    - `oci_object_storage`:
      - `namespace_name`
      - `bucket_name`
    - `yak_local_storage`:
      - `path`: the local path in the container where to find the artifacts.

#### Example AWS S3

```yaml
artifacts:
  provider: aws_s3
  variables:
    bucket_name: dbi-services-yak-artifacts
```

#### Example Azure Storageblob

```yml
artifacts:
  provider: azure_storageblob
  variables:
    storage_account_name: yakartifacts
    container: yakartifacts
```

#### Example OCI Object Storage

```yml
artifacts:
  provider: oci_object_storage
  variables:
    namespace_name: zrbhy7g7atj1
    bucket_name: dbi-services-yak-artifacts
```

#### Example YaK local Storage

```yml
artifacts:
  provider: yak_local_storage
  variables:
    path: /yak_local_storage
```
### From components

- `artifact_files`: a list of the artifact name relative to the bucket name (without the bucket name).
- `destination_path`: the directory into which to copy the artifact.
- `destination_owner`: the owner of the artifact at destination.
- `destination_group`: the group of the artifact at destination (for Linux only).

## Artifact (repository) structure

The Artificat "repository" structure is not fixed at all.
For instance to manage Oracle database software major and "minor" release:

```
└── rdbms
    └── oracle
        ├── AutoUpgrade
        │   └── 20210721
        ├── combo_ojvm+db_release_updates
        │   └── 19c
        │       └── 220118
        ├── dmk
        ├── gold_images
        │   └── 19c
        ├── interim_patches
        │   └── 19c
        ├── Opatch
        │   └── 19c
        │       └── 12.2.0.1.28
        ├── Pre-Upgrade
        │   └── 19c
        └── tools
```

## Examples

You have one example for each provider on Linux and Windows in the test file: `collections/ansible_collections/yak/core/roles/artifacts/tests/test.yml`.
