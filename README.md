# YaK

Get complete control of your hybrid cloud infrastructure with very few expertise. YaK deploys and configures your servers across various public cloud providers and/or on-premise in the same predictable way.

YaK Core is backed by [dbi services](https://www.dbi-services.com). Start free with an open-source license and extend your powers anytime with components to operate third-party software: Oracle, PostgreSQL, etc. More information on https://www.dbi-services.com/en/yak/components.

## Principles

The YaK is based on the following principles:

- **No lock-in:** The YaK Core is, and will stay entirely open source.
- **Extensibility:** add support for any cloud providers.
- **Modularity:** add components to operate any third-party software (Oracle, PostgreSQL, etc.).
- **Simplicity:** most effortless IT cross cloud provider automation system.
- **Powerfulness:** automate your operations in parallel on cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, and OCI.
- **Maintainability:** based on entirely Ansible and on Python if no Ansible native support available.
